                 <p> 	Skyscrapers orginaly came from the united states and not to mention it mainly came from New york and Chicago! The first ever skyscraper in the world was in Chicago and it was the Home Life Insurence building. It was built in 1885!

                 <p>       Back in the 1800s skycrapers were built in wood and sticks. That became an change after fire occured in cities espesicly "The Great Chicago Fire" when the whole city burned up becuase the city was full of wood. Additionaly, there wasnt that many skycrapers becuase wood wasnt that strong and if they tried to make an skycraper it would fall down becuase of the wind that blows in the cites.Also there was one perticulr building that survived and that was the water tower and Old St. Patrick church and that was only becuase they were made out of brick. Ever since then the world found an new meterial and that was steel. Now the new age world can build buildings over the clouds or even taller!
